# Python

Python is known as a simple language. Indeed, its clean syntax is condusive to the rapid creation of scripts, programs, and libraries with minimal boiler-plate. However, while Python may thus boast its simplicity, it also offers many robust features that lie unawares: for many are introducted to Python in an introductory programming course or through a playlist of tutorial videos, both of which are wont to leave out features useful for those who want to make clean, useful, shareable, and readable code.

Therefore, this workshop will cover the following topics in Python that may have gone undiscussed during previous exposures to the language:
- Everything Being an Object
- Organizing Packages
- Installing Packages
- Creating Classes
- Documenting
-
